Stephen Eglen's notes on future changes to ESS                   -*- org -*-

* Debugger

Would like to implement a debugger akin to Norm Matloff's work:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/edtdbg/index.html

Norm posted that he had started work on ESS, but had to abandon it.


* Comint so slow? ess-eval-visibly-p should be t again.

Why is comint so slow when passing code line by line?  Markus Triska

Hi Rodney,

I think ess-eval-visibly-p should remain true by default, as it is quite
useful. If you change the accept-process-output call in
ess-eval-linewise to:

    (accept-process-output sprocess 0 timeout-ms)

(the difference being that you explicitly state to wait for input from
"sprocess"), the test case works instantly also with ess-eval-visibly-p.

All the best,
Markus
